## About me

I am a collegiate assistant professor of [environmental informatics](https://vt.edu/academics/majors/environmental-informatics.html) in the Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation (FREC) department in the College of Natural Resources and Environment at Virginia Tech. 

### Teaching

As a collegiate assistant professor of environmental informatics (EI), I focus on undergraduate education in the EI major. I teach several courses that serve that major, as well as others in the FREC department and College of Natural Resources.

### Research

Even though my position is focused primarily on undergraduate education, I maintain an active research program. My research program is broadly focused on catchment hydrology. I am always looking for motivated undergraduate students to work with me to investigate hydrological processes!
